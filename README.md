# LOSS-BUDGET-OF-FIBER-OPTIC-

To be able to judge whether a fiber optic cable plant is good, one does a insertion loss test with a light source and power meter and compares that to an estimate of what is a reasonable loss for that cable plant. The estimate, called a "loss budget" is calculated using typical component losses for each part of the cable plant - the fiber, splices and/or connectors. If the measured loss exceed the calculated loss by a significant amount (remembering the inherent uncertainty in all measurements), the system should be tested segment-by-segment to determine the cause of high loss.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

The calculated loss budget is an estimate that assumes the values of component losses and does not take into account the uncertainty of the measurement. Be aware of this because if measurements are close to the loss budget estimates, some judgement is needed to not fail good fibers and pass bad ones.
